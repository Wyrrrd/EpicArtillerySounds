### Features
Changes the vanilla artillery sound to a far more powerful, resonant one. Bring the thunder to Factorio.

### Compatibility
This mod should work with all modded filter inserters, but I specifically added compatibility for the following mods:

+ [Bob's Adjustable Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobinserters) - rotated pickup positions
+ [Informatron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/informatron) - informational page to explain modes

### Credits
- Thanks to [MadClown01](https://mods.factorio.com/user/MadClown01) for the [original mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Epic-Artillery-Sounds).
