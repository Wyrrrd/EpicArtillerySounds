### Features
Changes the vanilla artillery sound to a far more powerful, resonant one. Bring the thunder to Factorio.

### Compatibility
This mod should just work, but I specifically added compatibility for the following mods:

+ [Bigger Artillery](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bigger-artillery) - also added (louder) sound to turret and wagon
+ [Light Artillery](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lightArtillery) - also added sound to turret and wagon

### Credits
Thanks to [MadClown01](https://mods.factorio.com/user/MadClown01) for the [original mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Epic-Artillery-Sounds).
